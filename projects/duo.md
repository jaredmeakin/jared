### Summary

I was tasked with developing a solution that would allow 9,000+ employees to easily self-enroll in a new third-party multi-authentication provided. I chose to leverage Express, Pug, and LDAPjs for this project.

### Development
This was the easiest part of the project. The Duo Mobile API was well enough documented and had a ready-to-use SDK. A few lines of code later I had the project deployed to an internal RedHat server.

### End User Training

In terms of the organization, this was a "small" internal project. So, I recevied no support from our training or marketing groups. Knowing this was a radical shift in User Experience I felt some sort of training/communication was essentialâ€”__so I made a training video__.

I started with a screen recording of the whole enrollment process. Next, I wrote a script for the voice-over. Lastly, I worked with a fellow developer, who happens to be an Audiophile, to get a crisp voice over for my video.

### Conclusion

All-in-all the web app and training video were a hit. The video empowered both users and support staff to quickly get everyone enrolled in multi-factor authentication.

Here's the finished training video:
